# Unified Exercise Database

## Overview

This file contains the complete unified exercise database created by merging data from three sources:

1. **complete_exercise_database_200.json** - 198 exercises with comprehensive attributes
2. **hardcoded_program_data.rb** - Workout programming context from existing programs
3. **seeds.rb** - Enhanced descriptions for key exercises

## Database Structure

Each exercise in the unified database contains:

### Core Exercise Attributes
- `exercise_name`: The name of the exercise
- `movement_pattern`: Primary movement pattern (squat, hinge, horizontal_push, etc.)
- `primary_muscles`: Array of primary muscles targeted
- `equipment_required`: Array of equipment needed
- `training_effects`: Array of training effects (strength, power, endurance, etc.)
- `complexity_level`: beginner, intermediate, or advanced
- `effectiveness_score`: 1-10 rating of exercise effectiveness

### Enhanced Information
- `enhanced_description`: Detailed description of the exercise and its benefits
- `workout_contexts`: Array of programming contexts where this exercise is used
- `is_in_programs`: Boolean indicating if exercise is used in any workout programs

### Workout Context Structure
Each workout context contains:
- `type`: "main" or "accessory"
- `sets`: Number of sets (when applicable)
- `reps`: Number of reps (when applicable)
- `notes`: Programming notes
- `program`: Name of the workout program
- `cycle`: Name of the training cycle
- `session`: Name of the workout session

## Database Statistics

- **Total exercises**: 198
- **Exercises used in programs**: 65 (32.8% coverage)
- **Exercises not in programs**: 133
- **File size**: 129,501 bytes

## Key Features

### Exercise ID Removal
- All `exercise_id` fields have been removed to allow Rails to auto-assign IDs

### Name Variation Handling
The system handles common exercise name variations such as:
- "Deadlift" vs "Conventional Deadlift"
- "Chin-ups" vs "Pull-Up / Chin-Up"
- "RDL" vs "Romanian Deadlift"
- "Bulgarian Split-Squat" vs "Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat (Bulgarian)"

### Enhanced Descriptions
- Exercises from seeds.rb use their original detailed descriptions
- Other exercises get generated descriptions based on movement pattern and primary muscles

### Workout Programming Context
- Exercises used in programs include complete programming context
- Multiple contexts possible if exercise appears in different programs/cycles
- Includes sets, reps, notes, and program hierarchy information

## Usage

This unified database serves as the complete exercise reference for the workout tracking application, providing:

1. **Exercise Library**: Comprehensive exercise catalog with detailed attributes
2. **Programming Context**: Real workout programming information for applicable exercises
3. **Scalability**: Complete exercise database ready for future program additions
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to filter by attributes, programming usage, or effectiveness

## Generation Script

The database is generated by `/script/generate_unified_exercise_database.rb` which can be re-run to update the database when:
- New exercises are added to the JSON file
- New workout programs are added
- Enhanced descriptions are updated

## Examples

### High-Effectiveness Exercise with Programming Context
```json
{
  "exercise_name": "Conventional Deadlift",
  "movement_pattern": "hinge",
  "primary_muscles": ["hamstrings", "glutes", "back"],
  "equipment_required": ["barbell"],
  "training_effects": ["strength"],
  "complexity_level": "intermediate",
  "effectiveness_score": 10,
  "enhanced_description": "Barbell pull from floor; add deficit, stiff-leg, or snatch-grip for variety.",
  "workout_contexts": [
    {
      "type": "main",
      "sets": 1,
      "reps": "5",
      "notes": "Heavy single set",
      "program": "3-Day Full Body Program",
      "cycle": "Base Strength",
      "session": "FB-B: Power & Deadlift"
    }
  ],
  "is_in_programs": true
}
```

### Exercise Not in Programs
```json
{
  "exercise_name": "Clean and Jerk",
  "movement_pattern": "hinge",
  "primary_muscles": ["hamstrings", "glutes", "front_delts"],
  "equipment_required": ["barbell"],
  "training_effects": ["power", "speed"],
  "complexity_level": "advanced",
  "effectiveness_score": 9,
  "enhanced_description": "Hip-dominant movement pattern targeting the posterior chain emphasizing hamstring development. A clean and jerk variation for comprehensive training.",
  "workout_contexts": [],
  "is_in_programs": false
}
```

This unified database provides a comprehensive foundation for the workout tracking application's exercise system.
