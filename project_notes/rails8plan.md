## Overview
This plan combines a step-by-step beginner approach with advanced best practices and code samples. Each phase starts with a simple checklist, followed by advanced/optional details. You can follow just the checklists, or dive deeper into the advanced sections as you gain confidence.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Models (Weeks 1-2)

### Phase 1 Goals:
- [ ] Create initial models necessary to represent workout programs
- [ ] Create initial controllers that support generation of workout programs
- [ ] Support creation and attachment of workout sessions to workout programs
- [ ] Support creation and aattachment of exercsies to workout sessions
- [ ] Build workout program generation engine fthat includes all 3 levels

### Phase 1 Non-Goals:
- **Storing Results**: We don't need to store user workout results
- **Custom Exercise Selection**: We don't need to customize exercises based on what's available to users
- **Non-standard programs**: We'll focus on lifting initially, so we can keep it well scoped
- **Ultra-optimized prescription**: We don't need to worry about super-setting, circuits, couplets, etc.
- **Beautiful front end**: We have a way to display our exercises. We'll work on the front end later

### âœ… Beginner Checklist
1. **Create your Rails project**
   ```bash
   rails new workout_tracker_rails --database=postgresql
   cd workout_tracker_rails
   ```
2. **Add useful gems**
   ```bash
   bundle add tailwindcss-rails view_component hotwire-rails
   ```
3. **Initialize Tailwind CSS**
   ```bash
   rails tailwindcss:install
   ```
4. **Generate core models**
   ```bash
   rails generate model Equipment name:string
   rails generate model Exercise name:string movement_pattern:references exercise_type:integer
   rails generate model MovementPattern name:string
   rails generate model WorkoutProgram name:string program_type:integer
   rails generate model WorkoutCycle name:string cycle_type:integer workout_program:references
   rails generate model WorkoutSession name:string workout_cycle:references
   rails generate model WorkoutExercise workout_session:references exercise:references sets:integer reps:integer notes:string order_position:integer
   rails db:migrate
   ```
5. **Seed initial data**
   - Edit `db/seeds.rb` to add some equipment, movement patterns, and exercises.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     rails db:seed
     ```
