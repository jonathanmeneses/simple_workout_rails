## Overview
This plan combines a step-by-step beginner approach with advanced best practices and code samples. Each phase starts with a simple checklist, followed by advanced/optional details. You can follow just the checklists, or dive deeper into the advanced sections as you gain confidence.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Models (Weeks 1-2)

### Phase 1 Goals:
- [ ] Create initial models necessary to represent workout programs
- [ ] Create initial controllers that support generation of workout programs
- [ ] Support creation and attachment of workout sessions to workout programs
- [ ] Support creation and aattachment of exercsies to workout sessions
- [ ] Build workout program generation engine fthat includes all 3 levels

### Phase 1 Non-Goals:
- **Storing Results**: We don't need to store user workout results
- **Custom Exercise Selection**: We don't need to customize exercises based on what's available to users
- **Non-standard programs**: We'll focus on lifting initially, so we can keep it well scoped
- **Ultra-optimized prescription**: We don't need to worry about super-setting, circuits, couplets, etc.
- **Beautiful front end**: We have a way to display our exercises. We'll work on the front end later

### âœ… Beginner Checklist
1. **Create your Rails project**
   ```bash
   rails new workout_tracker_rails --database=postgresql
   cd workout_tracker_rails
   ```
2. **Add useful gems**
   ```bash
   bundle add tailwindcss-rails view_component hotwire-rails
   ```
3. **Initialize Tailwind CSS**
   ```bash
   rails tailwindcss:install
   ```
4. **Generate core models**
   ```bash
   rails generate model Equipment name:string
   rails generate model Exercise name:string movement_pattern:references exercise_type:integer
   rails generate model MovementPattern name:string
   rails generate model WorkoutProgram name:string program_type:integer
   rails generate model WorkoutCycle name:string cycle_type:integer workout_program:references
   rails generate model WorkoutSession name:string workout_cycle:references
   rails generate model WorkoutExercise workout_session:references exercise:references sets:integer reps:integer notes:string order_position:integer
   rails db:migrate
   ```
5. **Seed initial data**
   - Edit `db/seeds.rb` to add some equipment, movement patterns, and exercises.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     rails db:seed
     ```

---

### ðŸ’¡ Advanced/Best Practices
- **Model Relationships**
  ```ruby
  # app/models/equipment.rb
  class Equipment < ApplicationRecord
    has_many :exercise_equipment_requirements
    has_many :exercises, through: :exercise_equipment_requirements
    has_many :user_equipment
    has_many :users, through: :user_equipment
  end

  # app/models/exercise.rb
  class Exercise < ApplicationRecord
    belongs_to :movement_pattern
    has_many :exercise_equipment_requirements
    has_many :required_equipment, through: :exercise_equipment_requirements, source: :equipment
    has_many :exercise_alternatives
    has_many :alternatives, through: :exercise_alternatives
    enum exercise_type: { main: 0, accessory: 1 }
  end
  # ...repeat for other models
  ```
- **Data Migration**
  - If you have existing data (e.g., from a TypeScript app), write a script or use `db/seeds.rb` to import it.
- **Component Architecture**
  - Consider using [ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org/) for reusable UI pieces.

## Phase 4: Next-Level Architecture - Dynamic Program Generation & Training Intelligence (Ready for Development)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Vision: From Fixed Programs to Intelligent Training System**

**Current State**: 2 hardcoded programs with smart exercise substitution  
**Next Level**: Dynamic program generation with training intent-driven logic

### 4A: Training Intent & Purpose System
**Goal**: Move beyond movement patterns to include training methodology in exercise selection

**Training Intent Attributes:**
- **Primary Purpose**: Strength, Hypertrophy, Power, Endurance, Mobility
- **Rep Range Categories**: Heavy (1-5), Moderate (6-12), Light (13-20), Endurance (21+)
- **Training Effects**: Neural adaptation, muscle building, power development, work capacity
- **Intensity Zones**: Max effort, sub-max, moderate, light, recovery

**Implementation:**
```ruby
# Enhanced Exercise model
class Exercise < ApplicationRecord
  # Existing JSONB attributes +
  # training_intent: ["strength", "hypertrophy"] 
  # rep_range_category: "moderate" # heavy, moderate, light, endurance
  # intensity_zone: "sub_max" # max_effort, sub_max, moderate, light, recovery
  # training_methodology: ["progressive_overload", "time_under_tension"]
end
```

### 4B: Advanced Set Type System
**Goal**: Support complex set structures beyond simple "3x8"

**Set Types to Support:**
- **Standard Sets**: 3x8 @ RPE 7
- **AMRAP Sets**: 2x8+ (As Many Reps As Possible on last set)
- **Burnout Sets**: 3x8 + 1x AMRAP @ 50%
- **Drop Sets**: 3x8, then immediate drop to lighter weight for max reps
- **Cluster Sets**: 3x(3+3+3) with 15s rest between mini-sets
- **Rest-Pause**: 1x8, rest 15s, max reps, rest 15s, max reps
- **Tempo Sets**: 3x8 @ 3-1-2-1 tempo

**Data Model Enhancement:**
```ruby
class WorkoutExercise < ApplicationRecord
  # Replace simple sets/reps with structured set_prescription JSON
  # set_prescription: {
  #   type: "amrap", # standard, amrap, burnout, drop, cluster, rest_pause, tempo
  #   base_sets: 3,
  #   base_reps: 8,
  #   rpe_target: 7,
  #   special_instructions: "AMRAP on final set",
  #   tempo: "3-1-2-1" # eccentric-pause-concentric-pause
  # }
end
```

### 4C: Dynamic Program Generation Engine
**Goal**: Program templates that generate variations based on methodology

**Program Blueprint Architecture:**
```ruby
class ProgramBlueprint < ApplicationRecord
  # methodology: "linear_progression", "conjugate", "block_periodization"
  # training_focus: ["strength", "hypertrophy", "power"]
  # experience_level: "beginner", "intermediate", "advanced"
  # training_frequency: 3 # days per week
  # cycle_length: 4 # weeks
  
  has_many :blueprint_phases # replaces fixed cycles
end

class BlueprintPhase < ApplicationRecord
  # phase_type: "accumulation", "intensification", "realization", "deload"
  # duration_weeks: 3
  # primary_intent: "hypertrophy", "strength", "power"
  # volume_progression: "linear", "undulating", "block"
  
  has_many :session_templates
end

class SessionTemplate < ApplicationRecord
  # session_type: "upper", "lower", "push", "pull", "full_body"
  # primary_movements: ["squat_pattern", "hinge_pattern", "push_pattern"]
  # target_training_effects: ["strength", "hypertrophy"]
  # volume_parameters: { main_lifts: 3-5, accessories: 8-12 }
  
  has_many :exercise_slots # replaces fixed exercises
end

class ExerciseSlot < ApplicationRecord
  # slot_type: "main_lift", "accessory", "corrective"
  # movement_pattern: "squat", "hinge", "push", "pull"
  # training_intent: ["strength", "hypertrophy"]
  # rep_range_target: "heavy" # drives set prescription
  # selection_criteria: JSONB with equipment, intent, experience filters
end
```

### 4D: Intelligent Exercise Selection Engine
**Goal**: Smart exercise selection based on training intent + equipment + user profile

**Enhanced Substitution Service:**
```ruby
class IntelligentExerciseSelectionService
  def self.call(exercise_slot:, user_equipment:, training_phase:, user_profile:)
    # 1. Filter by movement pattern (existing)
    # 2. Filter by equipment availability (existing)
    # 3. NEW: Filter by training intent compatibility
    # 4. NEW: Consider rep range appropriateness
    # 5. NEW: Factor in user experience level
    # 6. NEW: Account for fatigue/recovery state
    # 7. Rank by effectiveness for specific intent
  end
end
```

### 4E: Program Generation UI
**Goal**: User-friendly program creation without admin complexity

**Program Generator Flow:**
1. **Training Goals**: Strength focus? Hypertrophy? Power?
2. **Experience Level**: Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced
3. **Schedule**: 3-day, 4-day, 5-day per week
4. **Methodology**: Linear progression, DUP, Block periodization
5. **Equipment**: Available equipment selection
6. **Generate**: Create personalized program based on selections

**Result**: Custom program with intelligent exercise selection and appropriate set prescriptions
