# Workout Program System - Status Update

## ‚úÖ **Completed Features**
- **Database Models**: Full migration from YAML to ActiveRecord models
  - WorkoutProgram, WorkoutCycle, WorkoutSession, WorkoutExercise models with proper associations
  - Database seeded with 2 programs, 6 cycles, 21 sessions, 106 exercises
- **Program Selection UI**: Working tabs for 3-Day Full Body vs 4-Day Upper/Lower
- **Basic Views**: Index page shows program types and allows program selection
- **Database Architecture**: Flexible, extensible model structure

## üîß **Current Issues**
- **View Mode Buttons Not Working**: Program and Schedule view mode buttons don't function properly
  - Description view works fine
  - Program view mode selection doesn't respond
  - Schedule view mode selection doesn't respond
  - Issue likely in Turbo Stream responses or JavaScript event handling

## üöß **Next Steps - Priority Order**
1. **Fix View Mode Switching** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Debug Turbo Stream responses in show.turbo_stream.erb
   - Check JavaScript event handling in programs_controller.js
   - Ensure proper data attributes and targets are set
   - Test cycle selection dropdown functionality

2. **Data Source Migration** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Move away from YAML config file dependency
   - Convert to JSON file or hardcode in seeds.rb
   - Eliminate YAML parsing issues for future deployments

3. **UI Polish** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Ensure all styling matches reference app
   - Test responsive design on mobile
   - Add error handling for missing programs/cycles

## üìÅ **Key Files to Focus On**
- `app/views/programs/show.html.erb` - Main program display page
- `app/views/programs/show.turbo_stream.erb` - Turbo Stream responses
- `app/javascript/controllers/programs_controller.js` - JavaScript interactions
- `db/seeds.rb` - Data seeding (to be converted from YAML)

## üîç **Debugging Steps for View Mode Issue**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify Turbo Stream responses are being sent
3. Ensure data attributes match between HTML and JavaScript
4. Test if fetch requests are reaching the correct endpoints
5. Validate that DOM elements are being updated properly

## üíæ **Current Data Status**
- All demo program data successfully loaded into database
- Server running on http://localhost:3001
- Programs index (/) working correctly
- Individual program pages load but view mode switching broken

## üéØ **Success Criteria**
- [ ] View mode buttons (Description/Program/Schedule) work correctly
- [ ] Cycle selection dropdown functions properly
- [ ] All exercises display with proper sets/reps formatting
- [ ] Data source independent of YAML configuration
- [ ] Turbo Frame updates work seamlessly
