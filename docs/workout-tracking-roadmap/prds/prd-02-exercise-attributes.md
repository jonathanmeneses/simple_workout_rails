# PRD-02: Complete Exercise Attribute Population

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (2025-01-06)  
**Priority:** Completed  
**Dependencies:** None - Foundation complete  

## ✅ Overview - ACHIEVED
~~Complete the exercise database by populating all missing attributes for the remaining 89 exercises~~ **COMPLETED with 223 total exercises including 25 new advanced exercises**

## ✅ Background & Motivation - ACHIEVED
~~Currently, only 7 of 96 exercises have complete attribute data~~ **ALL 223 exercises now have complete attribute data (100% completion rate)**

## Goals
1. Populate all exercise attributes for 89 remaining exercises
2. Validate data accuracy and consistency
3. Enhance substitution algorithm accuracy
4. Provide rich exercise information to users
5. Create sustainable process for adding new exercises

## Functional Requirements

### Required Attributes per Exercise
```ruby
{
  name: "Romanian Deadlift",
  movement_pattern: "hinge",
  exercise_type: "main",  # or "accessory"
  primary_muscles: ["hamstrings", "glutes", "spinal_erectors"],
  equipment_required: ["barbell", "rack"],  # or [] for bodyweight
  training_effects: ["strength", "hypertrophy"],
  complexity_level: "intermediate",  # beginner/intermediate/advanced
  effectiveness_score: 8,  # 1-10 scale
  description: "Hip hinge movement targeting posterior chain...",
  instructions: "1. Set up... 2. Hinge at hips... 3. Drive hips forward...",
  common_mistakes: ["Rounding back", "Squatting instead of hinging"],
  cues: ["Push hips back", "Chest up", "Flat back"],
  variations: ["Dumbbell RDL", "Single-leg RDL", "Deficit RDL"]
}
```

### Data Quality Rules
1. **Movement Pattern Accuracy**: Each exercise must have exactly one primary movement pattern
2. **Muscle Group Validation**: Primary muscles must be anatomically correct
3. **Equipment Realism**: Equipment requirements must match actual gym needs
4. **Effectiveness Scoring**: Based on:
   - Compound vs isolation (compound scores higher)
   - Loading potential (more load = higher score)
   - Skill transfer (functional movements score higher)
   - Safety profile (safer exercises score higher)

### Exercise Categories to Complete

#### Squat Pattern (15 exercises)
- Front Squat, Box Squat, Bulgarian Split Squat, etc.
- Ensure proper quad/glute/core muscle tagging
- Account for stability requirements

#### Hinge Pattern (12 exercises)  
- RDL, Good Morning, Hip Thrust, etc.
- Focus on posterior chain muscles
- Note hip vs knee dominant variations

#### Push Patterns (20 exercises)
- Horizontal: Push-ups, Dips, Close-grip Bench
- Vertical: Military Press, Arnold Press, Pike Push-ups
- Proper chest/shoulder/tricep differentiation

#### Pull Patterns (18 exercises)
- Horizontal: Rows, Face Pulls, Reverse Flys  
- Vertical: Lat Pulldown, Muscle-ups
- Accurate back muscle targeting

#### Core & Carry (24 exercises)
- Planks, Rollouts, Loaded Carries
- Differentiate stability vs dynamic core work
- Include anti-rotation and anti-extension

## Technical Requirements

### Data Entry Interface
```ruby
# Rake task for batch updates
namespace :exercises do
  desc "Populate exercise attributes from template"
  task populate_attributes: :environment do
    ExerciseAttributePopulator.new.run
  end
end

# Service object for validation
class ExerciseAttributePopulator
  def validate_exercise(exercise)
    errors = []
    errors << "Missing movement pattern" unless exercise.movement_pattern
    errors << "Invalid muscles" unless valid_muscles?(exercise)
    errors << "Effectiveness score out of range" unless (1..10).include?(exercise.effectiveness_score)
    errors
  end
end
```

### Admin Interface
- Simple form for exercise editing
- Bulk import from CSV/JSON
- Validation warnings before save
- Visual review of changes

### Data Validation
- Automated tests for each exercise
- Cross-reference with exercise science sources
- Flag questionable effectiveness scores
- Ensure equipment requirements are minimal

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Research & Template
1. Create standardized attribute template
2. Research exercise science sources
3. Define scoring rubric
4. Set up data entry workflow

### Week 2: Core Lifts & Compounds
1. Complete all main barbell movements
2. Add major dumbbell variations  
3. Populate bodyweight fundamentals
4. Validate with fitness professionals

### Week 3: Accessories & Variations
1. Fill in isolation exercises
2. Add machine-based movements
3. Complete unusual/specialty exercises
4. Run full test suite

### Week 4: Polish & Deploy
1. User-facing exercise guide
2. Improve substitution algorithm with new data
3. Add "Why this exercise?" explanations
4. Deploy with monitoring

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Checklist
- [ ] Every exercise has primary movement pattern
- [ ] Muscle groups anatomically correct
- [ ] Equipment requirements minimal but accurate
- [ ] Effectiveness scores justified
- [ ] Instructions clear and safe
- [ ] Common mistakes addressed

### Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for data integrity
2. Integration tests for substitution logic
3. Manual review by certified trainers
4. Beta user feedback on substitutions

## Success Metrics
- 100% exercise attribute completion
- <5% substitution complaints from users
- 90% accuracy in movement pattern classification
- Substitution satisfaction score >4.5/5

## Future Enhancements
- Video demonstrations for each exercise
- Difficulty progressions/regressions
- Injury modification notes
- Performance benchmarks by level
- EMG activation data integration
