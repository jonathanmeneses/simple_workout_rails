# Simple Workout Tracking - Rails 8

A modern Rails 8 workout tracking application with intelligent exercise substitution and equipment-based program customization. Built with Hotwire (Turbo/Stimulus) for SPA-like interactions without heavy JavaScript.

## Features

- **Workout Program Generator**: Database-backed workout programs with cycles, sessions, and exercises
- **Smart Exercise Substitution**: JSONB-optimized substitution engine with movement pattern matching
- **Equipment Filtering**: Dynamic program customization based on available equipment
- **Modern UI**: Responsive Tailwind CSS interface with Turbo Frames for fast navigation
- **User Authentication**: Rails 8 built-in authentication with session management

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ruby 3.1+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Node.js 18+ (for asset compilation)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd simple_workout_tracking
bundle install

# Database setup
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed

# Start server
rails server -p 3001
```

Visit `http://localhost:3001` to access the application.

### Database Models Hierarchy
```
WorkoutProgram (full_body_3_day, upper_lower_4_day)
â”œâ”€â”€ WorkoutCycle (Base Strength, Unilateral & Core, Power & Plyometrics)
    â””â”€â”€ WorkoutSession (individual workout days)
        â””â”€â”€ WorkoutExercise (exercises with sets/reps/notes)
            â””â”€â”€ Exercise (belongs_to movement_pattern)

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Rails 8 with PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Hotwire (Turbo Frames/Stimulus), Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: Rails 8 built-in authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB optimization
- **Testing**: Minitest with system tests

## Development

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Development server
rails server -p 3001

# Database operations
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
rails db:reset  # Drop, create, migrate, seed

# Testing
rails test                    # All tests
rails test:system            # System tests
rails test test/models/      # Model tests

# Code quality
bundle exec rubocop          # Ruby style guide
bundle exec brakeman         # Security scanning

# Console access
rails console
```

### Project Structure
- `app/models/` - Core domain models with JSONB attributes
- `app/controllers/` - RESTful controllers with Turbo support
- `app/helpers/` - View logic helpers (substitution options, styling)
- `app/javascript/controllers/` - Stimulus controllers for interactions
- `app/views/programs/components/` - Reusable view components
- `db/hardcoded_program_data.rb` - Seeded workout program data

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Phase 0-2**: Foundation, UI, and authentication system
- **Phase 3A-3C**: Exercise substitution engine with JSONB optimization
  - Smart substitution algorithm with movement pattern prioritization
  - Equipment-based filtering with "No equipment" and "All Equipment" options
  - Pure Turbo Frame UI with helper methods and reusable Stimulus controllers
  - JSONB arrays with GIN indexes for fast containment searches

### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- **Phase 3D**: Complete exercise attribute population
  - **Current**: 7/96 exercises fully populated (Back Squat, Goblet Squat, Bench Press, Deadlift, OHP, Chin-ups, Ring Row)
  - **Target**: 96/96 exercises with correct movement patterns and substitution attributes

### Exercise Substitution System
The app features an intelligent substitution engine that:
- Matches exercises by movement pattern, muscle groups, and training effects
- Filters options based on user's available equipment
- Prioritizes main lifts over accessory exercises
- Uses JSONB attributes for fast PostgreSQL queries

**Available Programs:**
- **3-Day Full Body**: Complete body workout 3x per week
- **4-Day Upper/Lower**: Upper/lower body split 4x per week

## Data Management

### Exercise Attributes
Each exercise includes JSONB attributes for smart substitution:
- `primary_muscles`: Target muscle groups
- `equipment_required`: Required equipment list
- `training_effects`: Strength, hypertrophy, power, endurance
- `effectiveness_score`: Relative exercise effectiveness (1-10)

### Seeded Data
- 2 workout programs with 6 cycles, 21 sessions, 106 exercises
- Equipment database with bodyweight, barbell, dumbbell, and specialized equipment
- Movement patterns: squat, hinge, horizontal_push, horizontal_pull, vertical_push, vertical_pull, carry, core

## Testing

The project uses Minitest with comprehensive test coverage:
- **Model tests**: Validations, associations, and business logic
- **Controller tests**: Request handling and Turbo responses
- **System tests**: End-to-end user workflows with Capybara
- **Integration tests**: Multi-controller user flows

```bash
# Run specific test types
rails test test/models/exercise_test.rb
rails test test/controllers/programs_controller_test.rb
rails test test/system/program_navigation_test.rb
```

## Contributing
